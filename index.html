            	I am an Electrical Engineering Student at the University of Texas at Dallas with many interests. I'd like to specialize in circuit design or computing systems and I am looking for a position where I can put my creativity and problem solving towards products that have a broad and positive impact on people&apos;s lives.  
            </p>
            <p>
            	I am creative and a fast learner who can work to solve problems until clients are satisfied. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	I also work on websites in my free time and I am available to work on yours as a freelancer. You can review some of the sites I&apos;ve worked on below. Feel free to email me if you are interested.

            	The University of Texas at Dallas is known for its research and engineering program. Founded with aid from Texas Instruments and joining the University of Texas School System in 1969, the university has its roots in entrepreneurial endeavors within Dallas. Despite its size, the University boasts a top ranking engineering program, and is one of the fastest growing. The university is located in the direct vicinity of several large engineering companies, which allows to professors and researchers to have immediate access and knowledge about real-world industry.

            <p>
            	My first job over the summer of 2017 was in a newly-opened restaurant working as a host. While not the most glamorous position, the job taught me valuable lessons in working within a team, how to work with customers, and honed several soft skills I use today. It was also a fascinating experience because the wait staff and management were fairly small, allowing me to learn about the inner workings from the top to the bottom. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the fall of 2018 I accepted a position as a &quot;Computer Assistant&quot; with the UTD Office of Information Technology. This job had me monitoring student computer labs and helping anyone affiliated with the university with any technical issues they might have. This job also taught me a lot and let me glimpse into the inner workings of managing something as large as a university&apos;s information technology systems. Troubleshooting and managing customer expectations were both skills I learned during this job. 
			</p>
			<p>	
				Since the summer of 2018 I began working with the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering Communications Team updating various websites within the engineering.utdallas.edu domain. While I mostly updated existing webpages, I have gotten the opportunity to code some new websites and even gotten to do a lot of the heavy lifting for the new Mechanical Engineering website that is being developed. This position has allowed me to demonstrate and refine my soft skills in a much more professional office space. I have demonstrated that I can be trusted with a lot of responsibility and important projects during this job and I find that my experience here is unrivaled to many of the jobs held by my peers.
